let's test a few ways to do base setup.

Options sorted by fastest setup and shortest way to implement UI:

1. Gradio
   - Pros:
     - Extremely fast setup
     - Python-based, easy for data scientists
     - Built-in components for ML model demos
     - Quick prototyping
   - Cons:
     - Limited customization compared to React
     - May be challenging for complex, multi-page applications

2. Streamlit (current implementation)
   - Pros:
     - Fast setup
     - Python-based, easy for data scientists
     - Good for data-centric apps
     - Rapid prototyping
   - Cons:
     - Limited UI customization
     - Can be challenging for complex interactive features

3. React + FastAPI
   - Pros:
     - Highly customizable UI with React
     - Powerful and fast backend with FastAPI
     - Great for complex, interactive applications
     - Scalable architecture
   - Cons:
     - Longer setup time compared to Gradio or Streamlit
     - Requires knowledge of both React (frontend) and Python (backend)
     - More boilerplate code

4. Other options:
   - Reflex (formerly Pynecone): Python framework with React-like syntax
   - Plotly Dash: React-based framework for analytical web applications
   - Flask + React: Similar to FastAPI + React, but with a more traditional Python web framework

For the fastest setup and shortest implementation time, Gradio would be the top choice, followed closely by Streamlit (your current implementation). React + FastAPI offers the most flexibility and customization but requires more setup time and knowledge of both frontend and backend technologies.
