- No projects for now (to remove)
- Multiple blocks at same context block (to add)
- No prompt block for now (to remove)
- Context block structure
    - Logic
        - Every context to be actually separate blocks, not related to each other as they are now
    - Blocks
        - title 
        - content
        - buttons
            - delete
            - generate (if content empty) / regenerate (if content not empty)
    - Global context buttons
        - Add block
            - Select box of types (text, list)
            - Add button
        - Delete context block
    - Chat box
        - Input container
        - Send button
        - Output to be outputed in blocks rather then just message
