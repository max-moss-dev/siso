# Multi-Block Update Plan

## Completed Tasks
- Updated API structure to handle multiple context block updates
- Modified the chat endpoint to process multiple block updates
- Adjusted LLM prompt to inform about multi-block update capability
- Enhanced response parsing to handle multiple block update suggestions
- Implemented function to handle multiple context block updates
- Updated API response to include information about all updated blocks
- Adjusted frontend to handle multiple block updates in chat responses
- Updated UI to show pending changes for multiple blocks
- Implemented batch accept/reject functionality for all changes
- Added visual indicators for blocks with pending changes
- Improved diff visualization for suggested changes

## Next Steps to Improve Multi-Chat Experience

1. Make the llm automatically suggest updates for all the blocks needed, when changes to some block were added.

2. Make llm able to prioritize filling context blocks over usual message if possible.

3. Implement Selective Batch Updates
   - Allow users to select specific blocks for batch accept/reject
   - Add checkboxes or multi-select functionality to context blocks

4. Enhanced Context Block Referencing
   - Implement a system to easily reference multiple context blocks in a single message
   - Add auto-complete or suggestion feature for block references in chat input

5. Contextual AI Responses
   - Modify AI responses to explicitly mention which context blocks were used or updated
   - Highlight or link to relevant context blocks within AI responses

6. Version History for Context Blocks
   - Implement a version history system for each context block
   - Allow users to view and revert to previous versions of a block

7. Context Block Dependencies
   - Allow users to define relationships or dependencies between context blocks
   - Implement a system to update dependent blocks automatically when a related block is modified

8. Context Block Templates
   - Create a system for saving and reusing common block structures or templates
   - Implement smart suggestions for new blocks based on existing content

9. Performance Optimizations
    - Implement lazy loading for context blocks to improve initial load time
    - Add caching mechanisms to reduce API calls for frequently accessed blocks

## Testing and Documentation
- Develop comprehensive test cases for multi-block update scenarios
- Update user documentation to reflect new multi-block capabilities and best practices
