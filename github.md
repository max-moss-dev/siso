# Revision System Implementation Strategy: GitHub Integration

## Overview
Instead of building a custom revision system, we'll integrate our application with GitHub to leverage its robust version control capabilities. This approach will provide powerful revision tracking for context blocks while reducing the complexity of our implementation.

## Goals
1. Track changes to context blocks using GitHub repositories
2. Allow users to view revision history and compare different versions
3. Enable reverting to previous versions of context blocks
4. Utilize GitHub's API for managing revisions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. GitHub Integration Setup
- Create a GitHub App for our application
- Implement OAuth flow to allow users to connect their GitHub accounts
- Store GitHub access tokens securely for each user

### 2. Repository Structure
- Create a repository for each project
- Store each context block as a separate file in the repository
- Use a consistent naming convention for files (e.g., `block_<uuid>.md`)

### 3. Backend API Enhancements
- Create new endpoints:
  - POST /projects/{project_id}/github/connect: Connect a project to a GitHub repository
  - GET /projects/{project_id}/context_blocks/{block_id}/revisions: List revisions (commits) for a block
  - GET /projects/{project_id}/context_blocks/{block_id}/revisions/{revision_sha}: Get a specific revision
  - POST /projects/{project_id}/context_blocks/{block_id}/revert: Revert to a specific revision
- Update existing endpoints:
  - POST /projects/{project_id}/context_blocks: Create initial commit when a block is created
  - PUT /projects/{project_id}/context_blocks/{block_id}: Create new commit when a block is updated

### 4. GitHub API Integration
- Use GitHub's API to:
  - Create and manage repositories
  - Create, update, and delete files
  - Fetch commit history
  - Compare different versions of files

### 5. Frontend Updates
- Add a "History" button to each context block
- Implement a revision history view:
  - List of commits with timestamps and authors
  - Ability to view the content of each revision
  - Comparison view between two selected revisions (using GitHub's comparison view)
  - Option to revert to a selected revision
- Update the context block edit flow to create new commits

### 6. AI Integration
- Update the AI system to create commits when suggesting changes to context blocks
- Allow the AI to access and reference previous revisions when generating responses

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: GitHub Integration Setup
- Create GitHub App and implement OAuth flow
- Set up basic repository creation and management

### Phase 2: Basic Revision Tracking
- Implement file creation and updating via GitHub API
- Create basic API endpoints for listing and retrieving revisions
- Add frontend UI for viewing revision history

### Phase 3: Revision Comparison and Revert
- Implement GitHub's comparison view in the frontend
- Add revert functionality in both backend and frontend
- Enhance frontend UI with full revision history and comparison features

### Phase 4: AI Integration and Testing
- Integrate revision system with AI functionality
- Develop comprehensive test cases for the GitHub-based revision system
- Perform user testing and gather feedback
- Refine and optimize based on test results and user feedback

## Considerations
- Ensure proper error handling for GitHub API interactions
- Implement appropriate access controls and handle GitHub permissions carefully
- Consider rate limiting and implement caching where necessary
- Update the user documentation to explain the new GitHub-based revision system
- Provide a fallback option for users who don't want to connect to GitHub

## Benefits of GitHub Integration
1. Leverages a robust, well-tested version control system
2. Provides a familiar interface for users who already use GitHub
3. Offloads storage and version management to GitHub's infrastructure
4. Enables easy sharing and collaboration features in the future
5. Allows users to access their context blocks outside of our application

## Potential Challenges
1. Requires users to have or create GitHub accounts
2. May introduce complexity for users unfamiliar with Git concepts
3. Depends on GitHub's availability and API
4. Requires careful handling of GitHub permissions and access tokens

By integrating with GitHub for our revision system, we can provide powerful version control capabilities while significantly reducing the complexity of our custom implementation. This approach also opens up possibilities for future features like collaboration and sharing.
