# Login System Implementation

## Overview
Our login system will primarily use GitHub OAuth for authentication, similar to the OpenUI project. This approach provides a secure and efficient way to authenticate users without storing passwords directly.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. GitHub OAuth Setup
- Create a GitHub OAuth application to obtain client ID and secret
- Configure GitHub client ID and secret in environment variables
- Implement GitHub SSO (Single Sign-On) in the backend

### 2. Backend Changes

1. OAuth Configuration:
   - Set up GitHub SSO in the main FastAPI application file
   ```python:main.py
   startLine: 1
   endLine: 37
   ```

2. Login Endpoint:
   - Create a `/login` endpoint to initiate the GitHub OAuth flow
   - Implement redirect to GitHub for authentication

3. OAuth Callback:
   - Create a `/callback` endpoint to handle GitHub's response
   - Verify and process the OAuth token
   - Create or retrieve user information from the database
   - Generate a session for the authenticated user

4. Session Management:
   - Implement session middleware using FastAPI's SessionMiddleware
   - Create a custom session store (e.g., DBSessionStore) for managing sessions

5. User Model:
   - Update the existing user model or create a new one to store GitHub-specific information (username, email)

6. Logout Endpoint:
   - Implement a `/logout` endpoint to delete the user's session

### 3. Frontend Changes

1. Login UI:
   - Create a login page with a "Login with GitHub" button
   - Implement the OAuth flow on the client side

2. Session Handling:
   - Store the session token securely (e.g., in an HTTP-only cookie)
   - Include the session token in API requests for authentication

3. User Profile:
   - Display user information retrieved from GitHub (username, avatar)
   - Implement a logout button that calls the logout endpoint

### 4. Security Considerations

1. HTTPS:
   - Ensure all communication uses HTTPS, especially in production

2. CORS:
   - Configure CORS settings to restrict access to known origins

3. Session Security:
   - Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for storing session information
   - Implement proper session expiration and renewal mechanisms

4. Error Handling:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for OAuth and session-related issues

### 5. Testing

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test OAuth flow and session management functions
   - Mock GitHub API responses for consistent testing

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the entire login flow from frontend to backend
   - Verify proper session creation and deletion

3. Security Tests:
   - Perform security audits on the authentication system
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, XSS)

## Phased Implementation

1. Phase 1: GitHub OAuth Setup and Basic Backend Integration
2. Phase 2: User Model Updates and Session Management
3. Phase 3: Frontend Login UI and OAuth Flow
4. Phase 4: Security Enhancements and Testing
5. Phase 5: User Profile and Logout Functionality

By following this plan, we'll implement a robust login system using GitHub OAuth, similar to the OpenUI project. This approach provides a secure authentication method while simplifying user management by leveraging GitHub's user data.
