# AI-Powered Context Management and Chat Application

## Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered context management and chat application. It allows users to create and manage projects, each containing context blocks that can be used to inform AI-generated responses in a chat interface.

## Key Features
1. Project Management
   - Create, edit, and delete projects
   - Switch between multiple projects

2. Context Blocks
   - Add, edit, delete, and reorder context blocks within each project
   - Support for text and list-type context blocks
   - Generate, improve, and fix content for context blocks using AI

3. AI-Powered Chat
   - Chat interface with AI responses based on project context
   - Mention context blocks in chat messages
   - View and manage chat history

4. Context Updates
   - AI can suggest updates to context blocks
   - Review, accept, or reject suggested changes
   - Batch accept/reject all pending changes

5. User Interface
   - Responsive design with collapsible sidebars
   - Markdown support for chat messages and context blocks
   - Syntax highlighting for code blocks in chat

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- AI Integration: OpenAI API

## Current Development Focus
The current development efforts are focused on improving the multi-block update functionality and enhancing the overall user experience. Some of the ongoing tasks include:

1. Implementing automatic suggestions for updates to related context blocks
2. Prioritizing context block updates in AI responses
3. Enhancing the UI for reviewing and managing multiple block updates
4. Improving the mention system for referencing context blocks in chat
5. Implementing version history for context blocks
6. Optimizing performance for larger projects with many context blocks

## Next Steps
1. Implement selective batch updates for context blocks
2. Enhance context block referencing in chat messages
3. Improve AI responses to explicitly mention used or updated context blocks
4. Develop a version history system for context blocks
5. Implement context block dependencies and automatic updates
6. Create a system for saving and reusing common block structures or templates
7. Optimize performance with lazy loading and caching mechanisms

## Testing and Documentation
- Develop comprehensive test cases for multi-block update scenarios
- Update user documentation to reflect new multi-block capabilities and best practices

This project aims to create a powerful tool for managing context-aware AI conversations, allowing users to maintain and update knowledge bases while interacting with an AI assistant.
